# Bike-Record-Management-System
The Bike Record Management System is a web-based application that allows users to manage bike records through CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Admins have full control over records, while regular users can view and search bike details. It's built with Java (Servlets) and MySQL for efficient data management.
